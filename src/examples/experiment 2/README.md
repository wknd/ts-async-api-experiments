example 2, propertyB on root is optional, and gives warnings about why it isn't there.

I think all these rules are implementation specific, maybe you usually want something to be available, but sometimes it isn't, in which case you want to know why it wasn't there.

Maybe sometimes optional things don't matter at all, and warnings never bubble up.

Maybe for yet other situations, some errors bubble up, but some don't matter.
